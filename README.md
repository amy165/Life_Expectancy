# Life Expectancy — Exploratory Analysis & Prediction

## Project overview
This project analyzes a dataset of global health indicators to explore relationships
between socio-economic factors and life expectancy across countries.

The goal is to clean and prepare the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA),
and build a simple regression model to predict life expectancy.

This work was completed as part of a data science learning path.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this notebook, `Life_Expectancy_Data.csv`, was provided as part
of an online course and is derived from public health data originally compiled by
the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations.

Due to course and dataset licensing restrictions, the data file is **not included** in
this repository. You can obtain the dataset from the original source or the course
platform:

- Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/ciencia-de-datos-en-python-en-7-dias/) 

Once downloaded, place the CSV file inside a folder called:

/data/Life_Expectancy.csv

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Inside the notebook, the following steps are performed:

- Identification and treatment of missing values  
- Feature selection and transformation  
- Handling of outliers and inconsistencies  
- Memory usage and data type optimization  

The steps are well-documented in the Jupyter Notebook to ensure reproducibility.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploration includes:

- Correlations between variables and life expectancy  
- Visualizing trends and distributions  
- Scatter plots and histograms  
- Identification of potential predictor variables  

Visualizations are built using:

- `Matplotlib`  
- `Seaborn`

##  Regression Modeling

A regression model is trained using `scikit-learn`. The modeling workflow includes:

- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets  
- Fitting a linear regression model  
- Evaluating performance with metrics such as R², MAE, and RMSE  
- Interpreting model results in relation to underlying data patterns

##  Tools & Libraries

This project uses:

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn

##  Notes

This project reflects my ability to:

- Prepare and clean real-world datasets  
- Perform exploratory analysis and feature investigation  
- Build and evaluate predictive models  
- Document workflows clearly for others to follow

Feedback and improvements are welcome!
